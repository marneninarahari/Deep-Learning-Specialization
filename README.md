# Due to non-disclosure agreement, I am not able to post the worked lab assignments. However, the following are the details of the specialization.

# Deep-Learning-Specialization
https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning

In this Specialization, I have learned to build and train neural network architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, LSTMs, Transformers, and learn how to make them better with strategies such as Dropout, BatchNorm, Xavier/He initialization.
Gained theoretical concepts and their industry applications using Python and TensorFlow and tackle real-world cases such as speech recognition, music synthesis, chatbots, machine translation, natural language processing, and more.

## Applied Learning Project

Now, I am able to

• Build and train deep neural networks, implement vectorized neural networks, identify architecture parameters, and apply DL to practical applications.

• Use best practices to train and develop test sets and analyze bias/variance for building DL applications, use standard NN techniques, apply optimization algorithms, and implement a neural network in TensorFlow.

• Use strategies for reducing errors in ML systems, understand complex ML settings, and apply end-to-end, transfer, and multi-task learning.

• Build a Convolutional Neural Network, apply it to visual detection and recognition tasks, use neural style transfer to generate art, and apply these algorithms to image, video, and other 2D/3D data.

• Build and train Recurrent Neural Networks and its variants (GRUs, LSTMs), apply RNNs to character-level language modeling, work with NLP and Word Embeddings, and use 
HuggingFace tokenizers and transformers to perform Named Entity Recognition and Question Answering.
